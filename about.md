*Esme* is an intrepid lover of life, living in the magnificent land called the Pacific Northwest in the US.

She earned a Master's degree in sociology having studied queer theory, sexuality and gender as social institutions, and power and authority in society. She also holds two bachelor's degrees in liberal arts studies of philosophy and sociology. Moreover, Esme has opened her heart to life as a ***poetic and precious magical practice*** and ***applied philosophy***. 

Embracing and respecting the practice of many traditions and virtues, she has invited a creative and beautiful life to take root and grow. She offers the life skills she has developed in an intentional way through ***magical counselling, deep wisdom tarot sessions***, using the additional knowledge of ***astrology, Rune magic***, and the ***kabbalah tree of life pathways***.

Most of all, it is her relationship with the ancestors, guides, geniuses, and spirits that has allowed the blessings of others to enter her life.
