<em class="post-intro-text">These two cards have been on my mind lately since meeting my true love.</em> Soul mates. We seem to complement each other by seeming so different at first glance and then so familiar and similar. These two cards of the major Arcana of the Tarot are distinct and separate. And this is a meditation on them together. These cards are both channels for liberation, for souls to shine, and for the psyche to reveal itself. Let the journey of grief, joy, love, fear, contentment, etc. be embraced! These different cards show us there are various and distinct moments in life that foster our wholeness. 

## A Cosmic Dance That Encourages Us to Embrace Life
The Blazing Sun travels through all twelve signs of the zodiac in its ecliptic orbit during the yearly journey. The Moon, ruling the High Priestess card, revolves around the earth monthly in the ecliptic orbit around the earth. The earth traveling in a circuit around the sun creates this relative relationship. This is the Cosmic-Dance-creating relationship. Our star dances with other stars, this spiral dance. The Sun reminds us to dance, to sing, to be out in the light of Life. The unshielded heart craves to feel all of life.

## The High Priestess - The Inner Darkness
The High Priestess is the energy of inner mysteries, initiation, and meditation on things that need to be looked into, seen with the inner eye. This is the magic of sacred practices, inner sanctum, a place behind the veil, a separate reality that interacts and influences the normative everyday world. This is the element of Center. All possibilities are present here: the Void, the space beyond self. When The High Priestess is present she invokes an opportunity to journey beyond the pillars of Mercy and Severity. Between the pillars of the Tree of Life, from Kether, to Tipherath (The Sun) to Yesod (The Moon) to Malchut. The Kingdom of manifestation is a result of a traveling consciousness. There are many ways to get there. But this path between the pillars considers all of them from The Center of all possibilities. 

## The Sun - The Outer Light
The Sun, the god in the sky, is the creative force needed to renew our inner pursuits. The nights and days of our lives, the seasons, the cycles of our bodies, aging, and experiencing being here in the kingdom of manifestation is made possible by our sun. The Sun allows us to notice and celebrate our days, seasons and years on earth. It reminds us to be here now because our time on earth is limited. And nothing, no span of life, no type of lifestyle is guaranteed. Everyday is a gift for us, for our ancestors, for the living and for the descendants yet to come. Our fiery hearts, our animated spirits, the way we move in concert, a dance, our heat and our metabolism all come from the fiery life force of The Sun.

<span style="font-size: .9em !important;">*What do we do with our days? How will we live?* &nbsp;</span>During our days what inner wisdom, guidance, morality and ethics will we adopt? How we relate and travel in the world comes from within. Even when we receive messages from the external world we still have to make inner decisions. The life in our bodies comes from the earth, is the earth, the sun and animating spirit that is the foundation of matter. The universe is fundamentally composed of spirit. So how do we relate with spirit during our lifetimes? The more we reveal the soul to the self the more we are able to be in the flow of everything under the sun. Everything. The good, the bad and the ugly. We can experience life as profound, a precious gift. And perhaps then we can have the ability to more easily move on when the time of our death occurs. Each day is an opportunity to practice being the human we are developing from the inside. Eye contact with strangers, kind words...trying our best.

These are the Days and Nights of our lives. We are in this together. There is no separation, just the illusion of it. Both The Sun and The High Priestess can form a partnership of profound harmony and peace. ***Together there is balance for the hunger of the soul's expression.***
